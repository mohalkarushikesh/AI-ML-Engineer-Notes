## üåê What Is NLP?

Natural Language Processing is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines **linguistics**, **computer science**, and **machine learning** to bridge the gap between human communication and machine understanding.

## üß∞ Core NLP Tasks

### 1. **Text Preprocessing**
- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into words or sentences.
- **Stopword Removal**: Filtering out common words like ‚Äúthe‚Äù, ‚Äúis‚Äù, ‚Äúand‚Äù.
- **Stemming & Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their root forms.
- **Text Normalization**: Lowercasing, removing punctuation, correcting spelling.

### 2. **Syntactic Analysis**
- **POS Tagging**: Assigning parts of speech to words.
- **Parsing**: Analyzing grammatical structure (dependency and constituency parsing).

### 3. **Semantic Analysis**
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying names, places, dates, etc.
- **Word Sense Disambiguation**: Determining the correct meaning of a word in context.
- **Coreference Resolution**: Linking pronouns to the nouns they refer to.

### 4. **Information Extraction**
- **Entity & Relation Extraction**: Pulling structured data from unstructured text.

### 5. **Text Classification**
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detecting emotions or opinions.
- **Topic Modeling**: Discovering abstract topics in a collection of documents.
- **Spam Detection**, **Language Detection**, etc.

## üß† NLP Techniques & Models

- **Rule-Based Systems**: Early NLP relied on hand-crafted rules.
- **Statistical Models**: Use probabilities and statistics (e.g., Naive Bayes, HMMs).
- **Machine Learning**: Algorithms like SVMs, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks (RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers).
- **Pretrained Language Models**: BERT, GPT, RoBERTa, T5‚Äîthese revolutionized NLP.
