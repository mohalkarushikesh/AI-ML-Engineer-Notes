Below is a reorganized version of your AI Notes, structured according to parent topics for clarity and logical flow. I've grouped related subtopics under their respective parent topics (e.g., Machine Learning, NLP, Computer Vision) while preserving the original content and intent. I've also integrated "Torque Clustering" into the appropriate section and ensured the Table of Contents reflects the new structure.
