## 🧪 Regularization in Machine Learning

Regularization prevents **overfitting**, where a model memorizes training data instead of generalizing.

### 🔧 Techniques
- **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**: Adds absolute weight values to loss  
- **L2 Regularization (Ridge)**: Adds squared weight values  
- **Dropout**: Randomly disables neurons during training  
- **Early Stopping**: Halts training when validation loss stops improving  
- **Data Augmentation**: Expands dataset with transformations (flip, rotate, zoom)

These techniques help models stay flexible and robust on unseen data.

## 🔁 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

### 📌 What is an RNN?
An RNN is a neural network designed for **sequential data**. It maintains a hidden state that evolves over time, allowing it to "remember" previous inputs.

### 📈 Why Use RNNs?
- Ideal for **time-series**, **language**, **speech**, and **sequential tasks**
- Captures **temporal dependencies** across inputs

### 🔄 RNN Architectures
- **One-to-Many**: One input → multiple outputs (e.g., image captioning)
- **Many-to-One**: Multiple inputs → one output (e.g., sentiment analysis)
- **Many-to-Many**: Sequence in → sequence out (e.g., translation)

## 🎯 Cost Function & Optimization

- **Cost Function**: Measures error between predicted and actual values  
  $$C = \frac{1}{2}(\hat{y} - y)^2$$
- **Global Minimum**: The lowest point on the cost surface—represents the optimal solution

## ⚠️ Vanishing & Exploding Gradients in RNNs

### Vanishing Gradient
- **Cause**: Small recurrent weights (`Wrec`) shrink gradients over time  
- **Effect**: Slow learning, poor long-term memory  
- **Solutions**:
  - Careful weight initialization
  - **Echo State Networks**
  - **LSTM networks** (set `Wrec ≈ 1`)

### Exploding Gradient
- **Cause**: Large `Wrec` values amplify gradients  
- **Effect**: Unstable training  
- **Solutions**:
  - Truncated backpropagation
  - Gradient clipping
  - Penalty terms

## 🧠 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

LSTM is a specialized RNN architecture designed to **remember long-term dependencies**.

### 🧬 LSTM Cell Components
- **x**: Current input  
- **h**: Previous hidden state  
- **c**: Cell state (memory)  
- **Gates**:
  - **Forget Gate**: Decides what to discard  
  - **Input Gate**: Decides what to store  
  - **Output Gate**: Decides what to pass forward

### 🧪 Pointwise Operations
Each gate uses element-wise operations to control the flow of information.
