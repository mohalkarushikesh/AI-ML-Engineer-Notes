**Self Organizing Maps**

  define SOM
    Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) are a type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm, specifically a type of neural network, used for dimensionality reduction and data visualization. They are particularly useful for representing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional (usually 2D) space, revealing patterns and relationships within the data. SOMs are also known as Kohonen maps, named after their inventor, Teuvo Kohonen.
